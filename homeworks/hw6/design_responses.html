							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned that interface animation plays a crucial role in providing a smooth and intuitive user experience. The duration and speed of the animation, the use of easing, and the choreography in interface animation are important factors in creating a successful animation. Additionally, the article highlights that animation should reflect the movements we know from the physical world, such as friction and acceleration, to create a natural and familiar experience for users. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of the article was the explanation of different types of easing and their application in interface animation. The author discussed the importance of ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out curves in making the movement of objects look natural and realistic. It was interesting to see how subtle changes in the animation curve can influence the mood and perception of the animation. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals. If it does, you either need to soften it or even remove at all. That means that the animation shouldnâ€™t slow down the user or prevent from performing the task." </p>
