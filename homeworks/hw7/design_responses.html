							<p> What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)
								From this article, I learned about the importance of Gestalt principles in UI design, specifically the Common Region principle. The Common Region principle helps with information grouping, content organization, and can also be used for content separation or focal point creation. It enhances hierarchy, scanability, and aids in promoting information. The principle can be achieved through the use of line, color, shape, and shadow, often bringing elements into the foreground to indicate interaction or importance. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the explanation of how the Common Region principle can be applied to UI design. This principle enhances hierarchy, scanability, and aids in promoting information within a user interface. It also discusses the different ways to achieve this principle through the use of line, color, shape, and shadow, creating a versatile set of tools for designers. Good examples illustrating this principle, such as the card UI pattern, banners, and tables, further help in understanding its real-world applications.</p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Having an understanding of how your brain works will help you become a wiser designer; master manipulator of Visual Communication. It can help you determine which visual elements are most effective in any given situation, so you can use them to influence perception, direct attention, and cause behavioral change." This quote highlights the importance of understanding psychology in visual design and demonstrates how it allows designers to effectively communicate and guide users through a user interface. </p>
