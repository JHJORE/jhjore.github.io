						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> From this article, I learned that dark patterns in UX design are tricks aimed at confusing users and are becoming more sophisticated over time. These dark patterns can often lead to short term gains for businesses, but they have negative long-term consequences as well. One example highlighted in the article is how dark patterns were used as a weapon against democracy during the 2016 US elections, with fabricated news stories designed to boost clicks, engagement, and profits.</p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>My favorite part of this article is the discussion on the impact of dark patterns on democracy, particularly during the 2016 US elections. The author explains how companies in Macedonia fabricated pro-Trump news stories to boost clicks, engagement, and profits on Google and Facebook. Moreover, the article also delves into the issue of Facebook's NewsFeed algorithm, which serves both true and false news stories based on users' opinions, reinforcing confirmation bias and restricting the readers' ability to broaden their knowledge organically. This part of the article shows the potential consequences dark patterns can have on a larger scale. </p>

						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading; but the rationale is that 'if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it.'"  </p>
